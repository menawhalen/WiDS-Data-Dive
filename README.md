# Overview

Welcome to the WiDS Data Dive, in partnership with the Chicago/Illinois Red Cross.

You will have **90 minutes** to complete the following task. 

Below is a plot of number of incidents per month from 2014-2018 that the Illinois Red Cross responded to. As you can see, even ignoring seasonality, we observe a *drop* in total incidents in 2018. Our questions is simple: **Why**?
